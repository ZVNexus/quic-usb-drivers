This document provides guidance on enrolling the public key on the host machine for the successful installation of the quic-usb-drivers.
If Secure Boot is enabled in a system, all kernel modules must be signed with a private key and authenticated with the corresponding public key.

Follow the steps below to enroll the necessary public key.

Step 1 -

Enrolling public key on target system by adding the public key to the MOK list.

Execute below command on bash terminal:

sudo mokutil --import /opt/QUIC/sign/Signkey_pub.der

You will be asked to enter and confirm a password for this MOK enrollment request.


Step 2 -

Reboot the machine. At boot time, choose "Enroll MOK" and enter the password that was chosen in step 1.


Step 3 -

After reboot, verify the information about the public keys on system keyrings by using below command -

sudo keyctl list %:.platform

If \"hostname signing key : ***********************************\" is not present then repeat step 2.


Step 4 -

Now, public keys becomes permanent part of UEFI Secure Boot key database.

Please try again to install quic-usb-drivers. Now signing and insertion of modules will be taken care by installer script itself.
